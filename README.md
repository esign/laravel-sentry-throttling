Laravel includes a built-in mechanism for throttling exceptions, but it doesnâ€™t support defining throttling rules for individual reportables.
This package adds the ability to throttle exceptions specifically before they are sent to Sentry.
It's especially useful if you want to continue logging all exceptions locally while avoiding repeated reports of the same exception being sent to Sentry.
While Sentry does offer its own sampling via the sample_rate setting, that approach is percentage-based and less granular than exception-specific throttling.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require esign/laravel-sentry-throttling
```

You must configure the `before_send` option in your `config/sentry.php` file so that Sentry uses the throttling logic.
Add the following to your Sentry config:

```php
// config/sentry.php
return [
    // ...existing config...
    'before_send' => [\Esign\SentryThrottling\SentryThrottling::class, 'beforeSend'],
];
```

## Usage

### Implementing throttling

The recommended way to use this package is to implement the `ThrottlesSentryReports` interface on your application's default exception handler (typically `App\Exceptions\Handler`):

```php
use App\Exceptions\ApiMonitoringException;
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\BroadcastException;
use Esign\SentryThrottling\Contracts\ThrottlesSentryReports;
use Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit;
use Illuminate\Support\Lottery;
use Throwable;

class Handler extends ExceptionHandler implements ThrottlesSentryReports
{
    public function throttleSentry(Throwable $exception): Lottery | Limit | null
    {
        return match (true) {
            $exception instanceof BroadcastException => Limit::perMinute(300),
            $exception instanceof ApiMonitoringException => Lottery::odds(1, 1000),
            default => Limit::none(),
        };
    }
}
```

Whilst we recommend implementing the `ThrottlesSentryReports` interface on your exception handler, you can implement it on any class you like.

### Binding the interface

You must bind your implementation of `ThrottlesSentryReports` in the Laravel container so the package can resolve it. This is typically done in a service provider, such as `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Esign\SentryThrottling\Contracts\ThrottlesSentryReports;
use App\Exceptions\Handler;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->bind(ThrottlesSentryReports::class, Handler::class);
    }
}
```

### Testing

```bash
composer test
```
